            <h2>Gen Z Digital natives</h2>

            <p>
                The new generation of children, known as digital natives, are growing up using digital technologies from
                their
                childhood.
                Outside the classroom, their world is flooded with a variety of content. Everything is always at your
                fingertips. Anything can be learned.
                Learn from the best teachers in the world to teach it in every subject. You can study as deeply as you
                like.
                Online content, not printed textbooks. Some are interactive, and there's competition for better layouts.
                It is a competitive field to present the best ideas in the shortest possible time. When they sit in the
                classroom they feel a downgrade from all of this.
            </p>

            <p>
                A few college professors recently shared these kinds of problems with me. That the children sit in a
                class
                of 45 minutes or an hour and are very worried.
                Our average <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_span">attention span is 20 minutes</a>.

                <p>But why we get so bored so fast? It seems to be all driven by <strong>dopamine</strong>, the chemical
                    released every time we
                    do something rewarding and that makes us feel good. Being used to Internet, social networks and
                    instant
                    messaging, we got accustomed to constantly get instant gratification when we find something
                    interesting,
                    spiking dopamine in our brain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is why, when we perceive what we are reading or watching as dull or pointless, our attention
                    span
                    tends
                    to be dramatically reduced: we simply don’t get our dopamine hit by non-engaging or non-interesting
                    contents, feeling the opposite of satisfied and happy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ... If people, both digital natives and immigrants, are so used to being involved in interactive
                    activities
                    and receiving instant gratification, that’s exactly what they should get while learning something:
                    we
                    cannot
                    expect to use old methods to engage students who have a new way of thinking. Therefore, training
                    needs
                    to be
                    tailored to meet these new behaviors, “borrowing” structures and features from those digital tools
                    we
                    all
                    use in our everyday life.

                    These digital natives are fast-paced, visually-oriented, nonlinear, always-on learners. They have a
                    built-in instinct to swipe right when reading books, and the pace of technological change doesn’t
                    phase
                    them. It’s no wonder the old rules of engagement don’t resonate with them, and, more importantly,
                    aren’t
                    preparing them to thrive in an unknown future.

                    “The role of a teacher is fundamentally changing,” says Richard Culatta, chief executive officer of
                    the
                    International Society for Technology in Education (ISTE). “In the past, teachers were the content
                    providers because they were the only really reliable, ubiquitous form of delivering instruction.
                    That’s
                    just not the case anymore.”

                and that disconnect is coming head-to-head in the classroom. Gen Z isn’t interested in traditional
                passive learning. More than half say they learn best by doing, while only one in 10 say they learn best
                by listening. The students’ results make it clear: failure rates for lecture classes are 55 percent
                higher than active-learning environments.

            <h2> Embedded ICT </h2>

            <p>
                Embedded ICT is the use of digital technologies in the teaching of all subjects. It is not a
                separate
                subject but a way of teaching all subjects.
                This model is effective and pragmatic. I have observed this model in the ICT curriculum of the
                Kerala.
                Along with the digitally equipped classrooms, the teachers are trained to use digital technologies
                in
                their teaching. Using the computer, projector, and internet, the teachers can show the students the
                best
                resources available on the internet. The teachers can also create their own resources and share them
                with the students.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are some struggles in this model. The first is the lack of resources, especially in non-English
                languages.
                It require time to prepare the resources even though, internet has plenty of these resouces.
                The teachers need to be trained to use the digital technologies. However just showing visual content or
                or some presentation on the screen does not mean they are engaging the students.
            </p>

            <p>
                An alternative approach for interactive content is to author content directly for the web instead of
                using elearning platforms. While this typically requires content authors to have a deeper technical
                knowledge, it offers much more flexibility.
                We can create a much wider variety of types of experiences and above all, it is easy to publicly publish
                web content and
                share it with others.
