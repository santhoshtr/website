            <h2>Gen Z Digital natives</h2>

            <p>
The current generation of children, often referred to as "digital natives," are immersed in technology from an early
age. Beyond the confines of the classroom, they inhabit a world inundated with diverse content, where information is
instantly accessible. This digital landscape offers unprecedented learning opportunities, allowing children to engage
with expert educators across various disciplines and explore subjects to any desired depth.
</p>
<aside class="aside left">
    <p>
        Gen Zers are “digital natives,” a term coined by writer and speaker <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Prensky">Marc Prensky</a>. He originally used the term to
        refer to millennials born after 1980, as they were the first to grow up with connected computers. But Gen Z
        takes this term to a new level. Born in 1996 and later, these students grew up not only with computers and
        internet access, but also with smartphones, social media, and mobile devices.

    In contrast to traditional printed textbooks, online resources provide interactive and visually appealing content.
    Content creators compete to present complex ideas concisely and engagingly, constantly innovating to capture and
    maintain attention. This dynamic digital environment has set a high standard for information delivery and
    consumption.
</p>
<p>
    Consequently, when these digital natives enter the conventional classroom setting, they may experience a sense of
    disconnection or even regression. The stark contrast between the rich, interactive digital world they're accustomed
    to
    and the often more static, traditional learning environment can leave them feeling understimulated and disengaged.

                A few college professors recently shared these kinds of problems with me. That the children sit in a
                class
                of 45 minutes or an hour and are very worried.
                Our average <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Attention_span">attention span is 20 minutes</a>.

                <p>But why we get so bored so fast? It seems to be all driven by <strong>dopamine</strong>, the chemical
                    released every time we
                    do something rewarding and that makes us feel good. Being used to Internet, social networks and
                    instant
                    messaging, we got accustomed to constantly get instant gratification when we find something
                    interesting,
                    spiking dopamine in our brain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is why, when we perceive what we are reading or watching as dull or pointless, our attention
                    span
                    tends
                    to be dramatically reduced: we simply don’t get our dopamine hit by non-engaging or non-interesting
                    contents, feeling the opposite of satisfied and happy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ... If people, both digital natives and immigrants, are so used to being involved in interactive
                    activities
                    and receiving instant gratification, that’s exactly what they should get while learning something:
                    we
                    cannot
                    expect to use old methods to engage students who have a new way of thinking. Therefore, training
                    needs
                    to be
                    tailored to meet these new behaviors, “borrowing” structures and features from those digital tools
                    we
                    all
                    use in our everyday life.

            <h2> Embedded ICT </h2>
            <p>
            Embedded ICT refers to the seamless integration of digital technologies across all subject areas, rather than treating
            it as a separate discipline. This approach, both effective and pragmatic, has been successfully implemented in Kerala's
            ICT curriculum. In this model, classrooms are equipped with digital tools, and teachers are trained to incorporate
            technology into their instructional methods.

By utilizing computers, projectors, and internet connectivity, educators can expose students to high-quality online
resources. Additionally, teachers have the opportunity to create and disseminate their own digital materials.
</p>
<p>
However, there are challenges to overcome. One significant issue is the scarcity of resources, particularly in languages
other than English. Despite the abundance of online materials, curating and adapting them for specific needs can be
time-consuming. Furthermore, comprehensive teacher training in digital technology usage is essential.
It's important to note that merely displaying visual content or presentations on a screen does not guarantee student
engagement. True integration requires thoughtful implementation and interactive elements.
</p>
<p>
    An alternative strategy involves creating web-based content directly, bypassing traditional e-learning platforms.
    While this approach demands greater technical expertise from content creators, it offers enhanced flexibility. This
    method allows for a broader range of interactive experiences and facilitates easier public sharing and distribution
    of educational materials.
    This web-centric approach enables educators to craft more diverse and engaging learning experiences, potentially
    revolutionizing the way educational content is developed and disseminated.
</p>


<p>While choosing the technology, tools and applications for this kind of practice, I would strongly urge to based it on
    free and opensource software. Software used in school education should respect the privacy, security aspects. </p>
            <h2>Striking the Right Balance</h2>
            <p>
                In our increasingly digital world, the importance of computer science education cannot be overstated. However, as we
                integrate this crucial subject into school curricula, we must be mindful of maintaining a proportional approach that
                preserves the balance among all fundamental subjects taught in schools.

                Computer science undoubtedly offers valuable skills for the 21st century, including logical thinking,
                problem-solving, and digital literacy. These competencies are essential for many future careers and for navigating
                our technology-driven society. Yet, we must resist the temptation to overemphasize computer science at the expense
                of other vital disciplines. Recently, we are seeing the push to introduce artificial intelligence in to the
                curriculum. As a topic, AI is important in the current world. But we should be careful not to overemphasize it at
                the expense of other subjects.

                A well-rounded education is the cornerstone of developing critical thinking, creativity, and adaptability. The
                arts
                foster creativity and emotional intelligence; history provides context and critical analysis skills; literature
                enhances communication and empathy; and traditional sciences offer a fundamental understanding of our physical
                world. Each subject contributes uniquely to a student's cognitive and personal development.
                Moreover, the interdisciplinary nature of real-world challenges requires a broad knowledge base. Future
                innovators
                will need to combine computer science with other fields to solve complex problems. For instance, addressing
                climate
                change requires an understanding of environmental science, policy, and technology. Similarly, advancements in
                healthcare often arise from the intersection of biology, chemistry, and data science.
                By maintaining a balanced curriculum, we also ensure that students have the opportunity to explore diverse
                interests
                and discover their passions. Not every student will pursue a career in technology, and it's crucial to provide a
                foundation that supports various career paths and life choices.</p>

            <h2>ICT as Independent course</h2>
                <p>
In the contemporary digital landscape, integrating fundamental computer science concepts into school curricula has

                protection is
                paramount. Students must learn to safeguard personal information, identify potential online threats, and
                cultivate safe
                internet practices.</li>
            <li>Operating System Fundamentals: Providing insight into the core functioning of computers, this knowledge area
                covers
                file systems, process management, and user interfaces. Such understanding fosters a deeper appreciation for the
                technology that permeates daily life.</li>
            <li>Introduction to Programming: Basic coding skills are increasingly valuable across various disciplines. Exposure
                to
                programming languages like Python or Scratch can enhance logical thinking, problem-solving capabilities, and
                creativity.
                The computational thinking skills developed through coding are widely applicable, even for students who don't
                pursue
                programming careers.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>
By incorporating these elements, educational institutions can prepare students for the digital future, fostering a
generation of tech-savvy, security-conscious, and analytically minded individuals. This approach not only enhances
digital competence but also cultivates critical thinking skills essential for navigating the complexities of our
technology-driven world.

                    classroom, your teaching or your students’ learning, skip it.”

                Availability of educational content in many languages is a challenge. For example, in the age of AI, when we
                look at
                the corpus in Malayalam language in the web, it is mostly religious, entertainment or political content. There
                is
                very little educational content. The same is true for many other languages.

                The evolution from traditional printed textbooks to interactive online resources is a compelling prospect for modern
                education. This transition should be viewed as a gradual, iterative process that complements, rather than
                immediately replaces, existing print materials. The enduring presence of physical books in the near future
                necessitates a harmonious coexistence between traditional and digital formats.
            </p>
            <p>
                An ideal digital textbook would incorporate a rich array of multimedia elements, including:
            </p>
            <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Embedded videos for visual explanations</li>
                <li>Interactive animations to illustrate complex concepts</li>
                <li>Dynamic illustrations that respond to user input</li>
                <li>Hyperlinks for easy navigation and cross-referencing</li>
                <li>Extensive references to facilitate further research</li>
            </ol>
            </p>
            <p>

                The ultimate goal of this transformation is to recreate and enhance the knowledge-seeking journey that students are
                accustomed to in traditional classroom settings. By doing so, digital textbooks can provide a seamless bridge
                between conventional learning methods and the vast potential of interactive, online education.
            </p>
            <p>
                This approach aims to maintain the familiar structure and depth of traditional textbooks while leveraging digital
                capabilities to create a more engaging, comprehensive, and adaptable learning experience. It represents a fusion of
                time-tested educational practices with cutting-edge technology, potentially revolutionizing how students interact
                with and absorb educational content. </p>

            <h2>Public education and Edutech</h2>
            <p>


                Despite the recent challenges faced by Byju's, the edtech sector remains a fertile ground for innovation and new
                startups. The industry's potential continues to attract entrepreneurs, driven by several key factors:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Perceived weaknesses in public education: Many edtech companies build their marketing strategies around
                    addressing the shortcomings of traditional public education systems.</li>
                <li>Digital education emphasis: The majority of these startups focus on leveraging digital technologies to enhance
                    learning experiences, appealing to an increasingly tech-savvy student population.</li>
                <li>Untapped market potential: The education technology domain represents a significant, yet not fully exploited,
                    economic opportunity.</li>
                <li>Aspirational middle class: There's a strong desire among middle-class families to provide their children with
                    the best possible educational resources, often viewing edtech solutions as a means to achieve this goal.</li>
            </ol>
            <p>

                In light of these trends, it's crucial for public education systems to recognize and proactively address the
                challenges posed by the growing edtech sector. Effective ICT (Information and Communication Technology) planning in
                public education should aim to:
            </p>
            <ol>
                <li>Incorporate innovative digital learning tools and methodologies</li>
                <li>Enhance the overall quality and accessibility of education</li>
                <li>Bridge the perceived gap between traditional and digital learning approaches</li>
            </ol>
            <p>

                By doing so, public education systems can better compete with private edtech offerings while ensuring that all students,
                regardless of socioeconomic background, have access to high-quality, technology-enhanced education. This approach would
                not only improve educational outcomes but also help maintain the relevance and competitiveness of public education in an
                increasingly digital world.
