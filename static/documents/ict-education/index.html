            <h2>Gen Z Digital natives</h2>

            <p>
                The new generation of children, known as digital natives, are growing up using digital technologies from
                their
                childhood.
                Outside the classroom, their world is flooded with a variety of content. Everything is always at your
                fingertips. Anything can be learned.
                Learn from the best teachers in the world to teach it in every subject. You can study as deeply as you
                like.
                Online content, not printed textbooks. Some are interactive, and there's competition for better layouts.
                It is a competitive field to present the best ideas in the shortest possible time. When they sit in the
                classroom they feel a downgrade from all of this.

                    Gen Zers are “digital natives,” a term coined by writer and speaker <a
                        href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Marc_Prensky">Marc Prensky</a>. He originally used the term to
                    refer to millennials born after 1980, as they were the first to grow up with connected computers. But Gen Z
                    takes this term to a new level. Born in 1996 and later, these students grew up not only with computers and
                    internet access, but also with smartphones, social media, and mobile devices.

                A few college professors recently shared these kinds of problems with me. That the children sit in a
                class
                of 45 minutes or an hour and are very worried.

                <p>But why we get so bored so fast? It seems to be all driven by <strong>dopamine</strong>, the chemical
                    released every time we
                    do something rewarding and that makes us feel good. Being used to Internet, social networks and
                    instant
                    messaging, we got accustomed to constantly get instant gratification when we find something
                    interesting,
                    spiking dopamine in our brain.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This is why, when we perceive what we are reading or watching as dull or pointless, our attention
                    span
                    tends
                    to be dramatically reduced: we simply don’t get our dopamine hit by non-engaging or non-interesting
                    contents, feeling the opposite of satisfied and happy.
                </p>
                <p>
                    ... If people, both digital natives and immigrants, are so used to being involved in interactive
                    activities
                    and receiving instant gratification, that’s exactly what they should get while learning something:
                    we
                    cannot
                    expect to use old methods to engage students who have a new way of thinking. Therefore, training
                    needs
                    to be
                    tailored to meet these new behaviors, “borrowing” structures and features from those digital tools
                    we
                    all
                    use in our everyday life.

                    built-in instinct to swipe right when reading books, and the pace of technological change doesn’t
                    phase
                    them. It’s no wonder the old rules of engagement don’t resonate with them, and, more importantly,

            <h2> Embedded ICT </h2>

            <p>
                Embedded ICT is the use of digital technologies in the teaching of all subjects. It is not a
                separate
                subject but a way of teaching all subjects.
                This model is effective and pragmatic. I have observed this model in the ICT curriculum of the
                Kerala.
                Along with the digitally equipped classrooms, the teachers are trained to use digital technologies
                in
                their teaching. Using the computer, projector, and internet, the teachers can show the students the
                best
                resources available on the internet. The teachers can also create their own resources and share them
                with the students.
            </p>
            <aside class="aside right">

            </aside>
            <p>
                There are some struggles in this model. The first is the lack of resources, especially in non-English
                languages.
                It require time to prepare the resources even though, internet has plenty of these resouces.
                The teachers need to be trained to use the digital technologies. However just showing visual content or
                or some presentation on the screen does not mean they are engaging the students.
            </p>

            <p>
                An alternative approach for interactive content is to author content directly for the web instead of
                using elearning platforms. While this typically requires content authors to have a deeper technical
                knowledge, it offers much more flexibility.
                We can create a much wider variety of types of experiences and above all, it is easy to publicly publish
                web content and
                share it with others.

            <h2>Striking the Right Balance</h2>
            <p>
                In our increasingly digital world, the importance of computer science education cannot be overstated. However, as we
                integrate this crucial subject into school curricula, we must be mindful of maintaining a proportional approach that
                preserves the balance among all fundamental subjects taught in schools.

                Computer science undoubtedly offers valuable skills for the 21st century, including logical thinking,
                problem-solving, and digital literacy. These competencies are essential for many future careers and for navigating
                our technology-driven society. Yet, we must resist the temptation to overemphasize computer science at the expense
                of other vital disciplines. Recently, we are seeing the push to introduce artificial intelligence in to the
                curriculum. As a topic, AI is important in the current world. But we should be careful not to overemphasize it at
                the expense of other subjects.

                A well-rounded education is the cornerstone of developing critical thinking, creativity, and adaptability. The
                arts
                foster creativity and emotional intelligence; history provides context and critical analysis skills; literature
                enhances communication and empathy; and traditional sciences offer a fundamental understanding of our physical
                world. Each subject contributes uniquely to a student's cognitive and personal development.
                Moreover, the interdisciplinary nature of real-world challenges requires a broad knowledge base. Future
                innovators
                will need to combine computer science with other fields to solve complex problems. For instance, addressing
                climate
                change requires an understanding of environmental science, policy, and technology. Similarly, advancements in
                healthcare often arise from the intersection of biology, chemistry, and data science.
                By maintaining a balanced curriculum, we also ensure that students have the opportunity to explore diverse
                interests
                and discover their passions. Not every student will pursue a career in technology, and it's crucial to provide a
                foundation that supports various career paths and life choices.</p>

            <h2>ICT as Independent course</h2>
            <p>
                In today's digital age, introducing fundamental computer science concepts in schools has become essential. A
                well-designed curriculum should cover a range of topics that provide students with a comprehensive understanding of
                technology and its implications.
            </p>
            <p>
                One crucial area is basic user skills. Students should learn how to effectively use computers, navigate operating
                systems, and utilize common software applications. These skills form the foundation for digital literacy and are
                vital
                for academic and professional success.
                Privacy and security are paramount in our interconnected world. Students need to understand the importance of
                protecting
                personal information, recognizing potential online threats, and practicing safe internet habits.
            </p>
            <p>
                Operating system concepts provide insight into how computers function at a fundamental level. Understanding file
                systems, process management, and user interfaces gives students a deeper appreciation of the technology they use
                daily.
            </p>
            <p>
                Basic programming skills are increasingly valuable across various fields. Introducing students to coding languages
                like
                Python or Scratch can develop logical thinking, problem-solving abilities, and creativity. Even if students don't
                pursue
                programming careers, the computational thinking skills gained are widely applicable.
            </p>
            <h3>Digital literay - Media Literacy</h3>
            <p>Media literacy is the ability to access, analyze, evaluate, and create media in a variety of forms. It is a critical
                skill for students in the digital age, enabling them to navigate the vast amount of information available online and
                make informed decisions about what to believe and share. Media literacy encompasses a range of competencies,
                including: identifying fake news, understanding bias and propaganda, recognizing persuasive techniques, and
                evaluating the credibility of sources. By teaching media literacy, educators empower students to be discerning
                consumers and creators of media content.

                Atleast that is not my definition of digital textbook. Something boring on paper is still boring on a tablet or a
                laptop.

                    “Using technology simply for the sake of using it is wasteful,” Delzer says. “If tech doesn’t transform your
                    classroom, your teaching or your students’ learning, skip it.”

                    A digital textbook is a textbook that is designed to be read on a computer, tablet, or smartphone.
                    It is interactive, multimedia-rich, and can be updated easily. It can include videos, animations,
                    simulations, and other interactive elements. It can be accessed online or downloaded for offline use.
                    It can be personalized to the individual student, with adaptive learning features that adjust to the
                    student's pace and level of understanding. It will have hyperlinks and references to other resources for further
                    study.
                    <br />
                    By opening up the textbook to the web, we can make it a living document that is always up-to-date with the
                    latest
                    information. It won't be limited to students, but for anyone interested in the subject.

            <p>
                Another advantage of digital textbooks is that they are more accessible to students with disabilities. They can
                be
                read aloud by screen readers, enlarged for students with visual impairments, and navigated by students with
                mobility
                impairments.

                Availability of educational content in many languages is a challenge. For example, in the age of AI, when we
                look at
                the corpus in Malayalam language in the web, it is mostly religious, entertainment or political content. There
                is
                very little educational content. The same is true for many other languages.

            <p>10 years ago, Volunteers at Swathanthra Malayalam Computing, including myself, worked with Kerala State's education
                department to publish textbooks in unicode, and make it available in online in variable formats, including braille.
                However, our efforts were not successful.

                    In a major boost to the free software movement in the state, the school curriculum steering committee has
                    decided to set school textbooks in universally-accessible Unicode format.

            <p>I would love to see a transformation from printed textbooks to online interactive textbooks. This transformation
                should be iterative and should complement the existing printed books(it is not going away soon). I would love to see
                videos, hyperlinks, animations, illustration, hyperlinks, references in it. And students experience the same
                knowledge seeking journey they are already familiar with in class rooms too. </p>
