I just published a [VS Code language extension][1] to support syntax highlighting for [Stuttgart Finite State Transducer (SFST)](https://www.cis.uni-muenchen.de/~schmid/tools/SFST/) formalism to VS Code.

* [Download and install the extension][1]
* [Source code][2]

I learned how to write a language extension when I attempted [the opentype feature file support][3]. So I thought of applying that learning to SFST which I regularly use for the [Malayalam morphology analyser project][4].
