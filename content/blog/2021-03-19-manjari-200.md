A new version of Manjari Malayalam typeface is available now. [Version 2.000][3] comes with a few bugfixes and glyph additions. Most of the changes are based on a review by Google fonts team.

New version is available at [SMC website][1] for preview and download.

## Changes

* Design correction for Malayalam number 10 to better match the attestations (0d6b0fc2)
* Avoid glyphs that use components that are components themself (6fe9b35d)
* Add ligatures glyphs for ‡µª + ‡µç + ‡¥± version of nta (2c39ae08)
* Review and update diacritics alignment (c498245d)

* Revert "Use consistant hhea ascender and descender" and disable vertical metrics check in fontbakery (832e54e3 and 05a899d1)
* GDEF: Change the Mark glyphs to non-spacing and add more mark glyphs (550d0515)
* Improve fractions glyphs for consistant stroke widths (b6e70bb5)

The latest version is not yet [available at Google fonts][2]. But I hope it will be updated soon.
