I presented a paper titled "Modernizing Parametric type design - A case study of Nupuram Malayalam typeface" at [Typoday 2023](https://typoday.in), Banaras Hindu University. Here is the link to paper(pdf): https://typoday.in/spk_papers/Santhosh_Thottingal_Typoday2023.pdf

This is 16th edition of conference, hosted  by Department of Applied Arts, Faculty of Visual Arts Banaras Hindu University.

One of the memorables from the conference was my opportunity to meet [Muthu Nedumaran](https://muthunedumaran.com/). I had an incredible 2-hour conversation with him on fonts, curves, spacing and technology of Indian scripts.
