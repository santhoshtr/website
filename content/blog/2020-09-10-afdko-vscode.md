I just published a [VS Code language extension][1] to support [OpenType feature files](https://adobe-type-tools.github.io/afdko/OpenTypeFeatureFileSpecification.html) in the Adobe "[AFDKO](https://github.com/adobe-type-tools/afdko)" format.

The extension provides syntax highlighting and code snippet support.

The syntax highlighting patterns for AFDKO is based on the [opentype-feature-bundle](https://github.com/kennethormandy/opentype-feature-bundle) for Atom Editor by Kennet Ormandy  which is based upon [Brook Elgieâ€™s original Textmate bundle](https://github.com/brew/opentype-feature-bundle).

The code snippets are based on the snippets prepared by Simon Cozens for [AFDKO-SublimeText](https://github.com/simoncozens/AFDKO-SublimeText)

* [Download and install the extension][1]
* [Source code][2]

I hope this will be useful for font developers using VS Code for opentype programming and automation.
