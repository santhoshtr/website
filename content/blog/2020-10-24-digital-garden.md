[docs.thottingal.in](https://docs.thottingal.in) is my personal knowledge space I try to document and share everything I know about this world in form of an online [GitBook](https://gitbook.com) hosted on [GitHub](https://github.com/santhoshtr/docs).

## What is a digital garden?

In basic terms, it is a different format for written content on the web. Itâ€™s about moving away from blog posts ordered by dates and categories, into more of an interlinked web of notes. Blog posts are articles at a point in time, while here it is living document. [Digital gardens](https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden) are also known as [Zettelkasten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zettelkasten) or Second Brain.

I got inspiration from [Nikita Voloboev](https://wiki.nikitavoloboev.xyz/) to start this space. There is a [DigitalGardens community on Reddit](https://www.reddit.com/r/DigitalGardens/) which discusses tools to maintain & create these wikis. As well as how to use them to develop new [transformative tools for thought](https://numinous.productions/ttft/). [Here is a curated list](https://github.com/KasperZutterman/Second-Brain) of such Zettelkastens/ Second Brains / Digital Gardens.

There is no permananent links in this site, except the domain. Since this is a living document, I rearrange the content very often.
