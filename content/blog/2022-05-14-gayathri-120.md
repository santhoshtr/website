A new version of Gayathri typeface is available now. [Version 1.20][3] comes with a few bugfixes and glyph additions.

New version is available at [SMC website][1] for preview and download.

## Changes

* Fix the size issue of fullstop and comma
* Add 0D7B+0D4D+0D31 based ന്റ
* Improve kerning for latin
* Add 22 latin glyphs
* Fix spacing issues for quote signs
* Flatten the nested components
* Update build dependencies and CI

The latest version is not yet [available at Google fonts][2]. But I hope it will be updated soon.

[Gayathri][5] is a Malayalam typeface designed by Binoy Dominic and maitained by [Swathanthra Malayalam Computing][4]. Available in three weights, Gayathri is best suited for headlines, posters, titles and captions. Unicode compliant and libre licensed.
