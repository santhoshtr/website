I attended [Wikimania 2023](https://wikimania.wikimedia.org/wiki/2023:Wikimania), an annual conference of people working on Wikipedia and other Wikimedia projects. This year's conference was at Singapore.

## State of Machine Learning on the Wikimedia projects

I presented a talk titled "State of Machine Learning on the Wikimedia projects". Machine learning is used in many Wikimedia projects. This talk was be round up of various projects that use ML. I talked about:

* How Machine learning is used in our project, the benefits and impact.
* How we make sure the usage is as per the ML usage policies? The design, ethics and product considerations of ML in our projects.
* What are the challenges we are facing and how we are solving them?
* Potential opportunities that are worth exploring
