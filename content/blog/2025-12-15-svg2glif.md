I published svg2glif - a Rust crate to convert SVG vector graphics into UFO (Unified Font Object) GLIF format, making it easy to incorporate SVG artwork into font development workflows.

* [Source code](https://github.com/santhoshtr/svg2glif/)
* [Library documentation](https://docs.rs/svg2glif)

I am migrating my python based type engineering workflow to rust (fontmake -> fontc) and this is one of the tool I need.

```bash
❯ target/release/svg2glif -i examples/A.svg -o examples/A.glif --em-size 1000 --descent 250
Wrote glif to examples/A.glif (took 187.36µs)

```

Yes, 187.36µs 🚀😄

## Features

- Convert SVG paths to UFO GLIF format
- Support for cubic Bézier curves
- Configurable units-per-em scaling
- Unicode codepoint assignment
- Proper coordinate system conversion (SVG top-left to UFO baseline)
- Anchor extraction from SVG text elements - Text nodes in your SVG are automatically converted to anchor points in the GLIF file, useful for defining attachment points for diacritics and other mark positioning
- Both library and CLI interfaces
