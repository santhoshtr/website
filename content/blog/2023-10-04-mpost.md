I created a simple MetaPost playground website [mpost.thottingal.in](https://mpost.thottingal.in) where people can quickly write MetaPost code and preview the result.

This avoids the need of setting up MetaPost in your computer. Your edits in the code will be automatically executed.

This is part of exploration to use MetaPost for typeface design. Checkout the [Nupuram](https://gitlab.com/smc/fonts/Nupuram) and [Malini](https://gitlab.com/smc/fonts/Malini) typefaces designed using MetaPost.  I also started a repository of various type design concepts illustrated using MetaPost: https://github.com/santhoshtr/type-concepts
