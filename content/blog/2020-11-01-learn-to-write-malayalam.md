In my [previous blog post](/blog/2020/10/27/learning-to-write-malayalam-svg-animation/), I wrote about an experiment of using SVG path animation to help learn malayalam letter writing. That prototype application was well received by many people and that encouraged me to host it as a proper application.

Now, the Malayalam learning application is available at https://learn.smc.org.in

I added all letters of Malayalam there. Added a few common ligatures too. [Kavya](https://kavyamanohar.com/) helped to record and add pronunication of these letters with couple of examples.

This application also got a mention in Malayalam Manorama news paper when they featured language computing application as part of [Keralapiravi](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kerala_Piravi)(November 1) special coverage.
