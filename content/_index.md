At [Swathanthra Malayalam Computing][1], I lead various language computing projects that enable millions of Malayalam users on their computers and phones. My contributions to Malayalam digital typography include designing popular typefaces such as Chilanka, Manjari, Nupuram, and Malini. I also maintain several other Malayalam unicode fonts, all available on the [SMC website][2].

In recognition of my contributions to Malayalam language, I was honored with the [Maharshi Badrayan Vyas Samman by the President of India][8] in 2019. I also received the Mathrubhasha Puraskaram 2019 from the [Sree Sankaracharya University of Sanskrit][9], Kalady.

Currently, I serve as Principal Software Engineer on the Language Engineering team at Wikimedia Foundation. My work focuses on MediaWiki language support, internationalization, localization, input methods for the numerous languages in which Wikipedia exists, fonts, and translation tools. I work remotely from Thiruvananthapuram, Kerala, India.
